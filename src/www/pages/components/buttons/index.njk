{# About #}
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Buttons</strong> should be used in situations where a user might need to preform an
  action, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submitting a form</li>
  <li>Uploading</li>
  <li>Specify a next or previous step in a process</li>
  <li>Begin a new task</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two types of button used in this design system - buttons and <a href="/components/links/">link buttons</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>button</strong> performs an action on a page</li>
  <li>A <a href="/components/links/">link button</a> takes the user to a different page</li>
</ul>
<p>Icons should only be used where it is deemed absolutely necessary to communicate the meaning of an action.</p>
