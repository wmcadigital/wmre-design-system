    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows the user to search for information across the West Midlands Combined Authority website</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When to use it?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When a user needs to find the information they need, which they cannot find through the main navigation</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Users should only be able to access the search function through the header by hovering or selecting the magnifying glass icon</li>
        <li>The search bar will appear in a dropdown along with the ‘I want to…’ feature, where users can access popular search queries</li>
        <li>Once a user submits their search query, they will be able to view the search results. They can sort and filter the search results on the search results page</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Filter</h2>
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This gives the user the option to filter search results using a predetermined set of filters</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When to use it?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The filters will narrow down the search results by displaying pages which only match the filter criteria</li>
        <li>On mobile, the filter options will appear when a user clicks on the ‘Filter your results button’. This will trigger an overlay where users can select and apply filters. This is to reduce page size on smaller devices</li>
    </ul>
    

    {# End search filter #}
    <br><br>
    {# Search result #}
    <h2>Search result</h2>
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is how a matching page will display in the search results page</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each page result will show the page breadcrumbs on desktop. On mobile, breadcrumbs are not shown. This is to reduce page size on smaller devices</li>
        <li>The page description will display main body copy which is highest on the page. The description will be a maximum of 150 characters. Any descriptions longer than 150 characters will be truncated.</li>
        <li>If the user’s search query is in the page description, it will be highlighted in bold. This is to help them understand the context of the page</li>
        <li>The horizontal rule at the bottom of a search result is to make the results list easier to scan.</li>
    </ul>
    
    {# End search result #}
    <br><br>
    {# Pagination #}
    <h2>Pagination links</h2>
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows the user to navigate through search results.</li>
